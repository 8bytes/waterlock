With the new release of waterlock comes a new [api](/api/), with this you can now extend and modify the flow of user authentication in your Sails app. You can check out an example of one possible implementation via this [github repo](https://github.com/davidrivera/sails-waterlock-example). This release also comes with various bug fixes, to check out the full list of what was changed see the [changelog](https://github.com/davidrivera/waterlock/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). 

With this release out of the way I wanna start focusing on expanding on support of other authentication services such as sign-in with github,google,etc. possibly even ldap at some point. I'm not sure I'll just go where ever the code takes me. As always if you have any feature requests or bug reports feel free to submit them via the [github repo](https://github.com/davidrivera/waterlock). Thanks a bunch guys!
